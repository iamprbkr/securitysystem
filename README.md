#Security system built on Windows IoT Core


Home security systems are a growing field of projects for Makers. A self-built system is not only less expensive than a bulky professional installation, but it also allows for total control and customization to suit your needs. 

This project support several configurations:
  1. The base configuration uses a USB camera and PIR motion sensor
  2. Alternatively, a D-Link IP camera can be used for both sensing motion and taking pictures
  3. Additionally, photos can be stored in OneDrive
  4. Additionally, photos can be stored in Azure blob storage, and a website can be deployed to Azure ot view the photos
